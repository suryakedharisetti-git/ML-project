"Category,Feature,Importance (Gradient Boosting),Importance (Random Forest est.),Key Insight"
"Top Predictor,Vitamin_A_Intake_ug,0.1962,~0.157,Strongest predictor across models; deficiencies strongly linked to hidden hunger"
"Top Predictor,Folate_Intake_ug,0.1534,~0.146,Consistently top predictor; critical for growth and maternal health"
"Top Predictor,Zinc_Intake_mg,0.1436,~0.152,High predictive power; tied to immunity and child development"
"Supporting Predictor,Iron_Intake_mg,0.1473,~0.141,Important but slightly less consistent across models; linked with anemia"
"Supporting Predictor,Vitamin_D_Intake_IU,0.1153,~0.147,Moderate predictor; relevant but not as decisive as A/Folate/Zinc"
"Socioeconomic,Income_Bracket,0.1059,~0.128,Clear link; lower-income groups show higher hidden hunger risk"
"Socioeconomic,Age,0.1007,~0.141,Children/adolescents more vulnerable when intakes are low"
"Lower Impact,Education_Level,0.0309,~0.040,Weak predictor; awareness still beneficial"
"Lower Impact,Gender,0.0069,~0.025,Minimal impact compared to nutrients and socioeconomic factors"
